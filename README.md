# El-Araby_VESTEL_Alternative_Generator

## About The Project
The El-Araby_VESTEL_Alternative_Generator is a software application designed to address the challenge of identifying alternative spare parts for a specific component. By utilizing advanced file-handling techniques, this program efficiently retrieves data from a source file and generates an output file containing all available alternatives of every specific component.

## Features and Functionality
* Seamlessly processes a textFile.txt, which comprises two columns of numbers representing the spare part code and its corresponding alternative code.
* Provides the flexibility to input either the file path or the relative path of the desired input file.
* Initiates the program execution by pressing the return key, after which the application proceeds to process the data.
